# 100-Specs
There are 100 test Specs in this exercise when you first visit the page you will see failing tests, your job is to write code that will satisfy the tests requirements.

## Work Flow
Write code that will make each test pass one at a time. When an entire code block passes, commit your changes to Git.

### Example 1:

## What is Gulp?!
Gulp is a task runner, it can do many things with the help from Gulp-Packages.
If you have not used the Gulp task runner before you will need to run the command:

    npm install -g gulp

### What is LiveReload?!
*LiveReload* saves us sometime by detecting when a file changes in our project and automatically refreshes the brower for us!
You can get the [Install LiveReload Chrome plugin here](http://tinyurl.com/chrome-livereload)


## Extra Tips
Since we have LiveReload running we don't have to manually refresh our browser anymore. One tip is to have your browser take up one-half of your screen vertically and then have your Text Editor take up the otehr half. As you make changes and save your progress you'll see the browser update itself. Immediate feedback feels gooooood.
